A small amount of meta-data is required in cookbooks. This information is used to provide hints to the Chef Server as to what cookbooks should be deployed to a given node, and in the future it will be integral to an automated system for discovering and installing cookbooks.

h4.  [Providers] 
{td}
{td}

h4.  [Resources]  
{td}
{td}
A cross platform abstraction of the thing you're configuring on the host. For example, packages may be installed via apt, yum, or the BSD ports and packages systems, but the package resource abstracts these differences away so you can specify that a package should be installed in a cross-platform way. Chef's resources are mostly just containers for data, with some basic validation functionality.

h4.   [Roles] 
{td}
{td} 
Provide a means of grouping similar features of similar nodes, providing a mechanism for easily composing sets of functionality. At web scale, you almost never have just one of something, so you use roles to express the parts of the configuration that are shared by a group of Nodes.
